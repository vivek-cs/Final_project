# Dosa Restaurant Order Processing

This project processes customer orders from a JSON file and generates two output files:
- `customers.json`: Contains customer phone numbers and names.
- `items.json`: Contains item names, prices, and order counts.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Place the `example_orders.json` file in the same directory.
3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   python process_orders.py example_orders.json
